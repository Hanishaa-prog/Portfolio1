    <p class="description-text">
      Hey! I'm someone who’s always been drawn to building things, whether it’s designing a webpage, <br>organizing things, or putting together a group project that just works. 
      <br>I love using creativity and attention to detail to turn ideas into something clean, functional, and meaningful.
      <br>Organization is my secret weapon, I'm the kind of person who actually enjoys planning things out <br>and making sure every detail fits into place. 
      <br>But I’m also big on learning from people around me. Whether it’s feedback on my work or watching how <br>others solve problems, I’m always looking to improve.
      <br>I enjoy working in teams where everyone brings something different to the table. Good communication and <br>collaboration make all the difference, and I like being part of that. 
      And when it comes to problem-solving, <br>I don’t panic, I just get curious. I break things down, figure out what’s not working, and find smart, practical solutions.<br  />
      <br>In short: I like designing functional web pages, building cool stuff, and working with great people.
